## Stefano De Vuono
### Software Engineer | Backend | Frontend | Infrastructure
Hi. My name is Stefano De Vuono (he/him). I'm sometimes a San Francisco-based and sometimes Earth-based software engineer. I've often straddled the line between art and technology, design and code. I wrote my first university essay on emacs on my new Linux install. I've worked as a web (andsometimes embedded hardware) developer a digital art startup, where I designed and patented a digital image security system. I've helped a client revamped their docker-compose based developer tooling, shortening their onboarding from two weeks to less than a day. I've taught myself enough math and Rust to give a lunch talk and demo of RSA encryption. I've collaborated with artists to develop interactive installations. Currently, I consult, contribute to open source, and travel stay mostly at home.

My interests include dance, math, art, and of course computing.

Feel free to say "hi," "bonjour," or "buongiorno."
